# IA_CNN
Repository of course completion work (Computer Science).


The work aimed to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to be able to correctly identify each room through images of the internal environments of a simulated house.


The TCC.pdf file contains all the theoretical part of the course conclusion work.


The CNN.ipynb file contains the convolutional neural network built in Google Colab.
